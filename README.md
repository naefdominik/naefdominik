# 👋 Hey, I’m Dominik

I’m a **Computer Science graduate with a strong focus on Interaction Design, Interface Design, and Human‑Centered Systems**. I love building things that sit at the intersection of **technology, health, and playful interaction** — from therapy tools to experimental games.



## What I’m into

* 🦾 **Health Tech**
  Designing and evaluating **voice‑based digital biomarkers** for mood and mental‑health research.
  (Bachelor thesis + multiple research‑oriented prototypes)

* 🧩 **Human‑Centered & Interaction Design**
  Strong interest in usable, ethical, and expressive systems — especially in sensitive domains like psychotherapy.

* 🎮 **Game Development & Playful Systems**
  Local multiplayer games, weird mechanics, sensor‑based interactions, and fast prototyping in **Unity** and **Android**.

* 🛠️ **Full‑Stack Prototyping**
  From backend data models and APIs to frontend interaction, 3D visualizations, and experimental UIs.



**Let’s talk**
If you’re into interaction design, interfaces, or human‑centered tech — I’m always happy to exchange ideas.
